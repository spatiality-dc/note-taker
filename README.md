AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Lessons Learned

- Javascript is still hard.

- I honestly don't know what the NPM package uuid does, but it had a huge number of downloads and fixed my problem. Like, I know it can add unique IDs, but I don't understand the logic behind how it adds unique IDs. I suppose that's something I'll have to learn on my own.
